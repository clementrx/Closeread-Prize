    "text": "The javelin throw is one of those sports that feels almost mythical. Watching an athlete hurl a spear-like object across a field with raw power and flawless technique is mesmerizing. And when it comes to records in this event, they’re nothing short of legendary. The men’s world record, held by Jan Železný since 1996 at an astounding 98.48 meters.\n\n\n\n\nWhile the current women’s world record was set by Barbora Špotáková in 2008, with a stunning throw of 72.28 meters.Theses marks seem almost untouchable, raising the question: Is there even room to go further ?\n\n\n\n\nWhat does it really take to break a javelin throw record? Is it all about raw strength and skill, or do things like biomechanics, equipment, and weather play a part too? And, are we nearing the limits of what the human body can achieve?\n\n\n\n\n(P.S. Here’s a pic of me throwing, I’m getting closer!)"
